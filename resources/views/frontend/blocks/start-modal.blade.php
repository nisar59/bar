							During the month of March, Caffe Dante will launch “A Taste of Italy.”  An ongoing program that brings together Italian hospitality legends from around the world and invites guests to learn about the tradition of aperitivo from those who know it best - the Italians. This programming will go on to include bar pop-ups, chef residencies, musical performances, and more - all celebrating Italian culture.
							Caffe Dante will host a series of bar pop-ups , featuring some of Dante's favorite Italian bars and bartenders. Each visiting bartender will hold a 3-day residency (Monday-Wednesday) at Caffe Dante, where they will serve 5 of their signature cocktails from 2-5pm. A portion from every cocktail will be donated to World Central Kitchen. As a food special, we will also serve arancini.
							The pop-ups include: Salvatore Calabrese & Federico Pavan of The Donovan Bar in London (February 28-March 1) the art deco-inspired bar in the Brown’s Hotel led by the legendary Italian bartender Salvatore Calabrese (a.k.a “The Maestro”); Tommaso Mansi + Luigi Gallo of Belmond Caruso hotel in Ravello (March 6-8) an a 11th-century palace overlooking the Amalfi Coast inspired by local produce - specifically, Amalfi lemons; Alexander Frezza of L'Antiquario in Naples (March 13-15) a moody, speakeasy-inspired den with live jazz; and Riccardo Rossi of Freni e Frizioni in Rome (March 20-22) set in a former mechanic’s workshop offering a cool, contemporary take on aperitivo.
							Salute!
